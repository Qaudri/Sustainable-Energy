                <p>Solar energy, the collection of heat from the sun through solar panels and then converting and storing for household use. The energy can be used for different 
                    purposes, for example, water heating. The heat collected in such cases is usually small. It is really efficient and produces zero emmissions.
                </p>

                <p>In other cases, when the energy is collected and stored in large amounts, it can be converted into electricity. The electricity generated can now be used to power
                    different tools and equipments. Such devices are then put to use by humans. This way, an entire house could be supplied with electricity without causing any harm to the planet.

                    means less CO2 emmissions which in turn translates to prolonged sustainability of life.
